# Real-Time-Insect-Monitoring-AI

Accurate real-time detection of insect pollinators is a critical challenge faced globally. This repository focuses on tracking and identifying pollinators visiting sunflowers, utilizing advanced detection techniques to deliver insightful results, as demonstrated in the video below:

If presented by a challenge of quantifying behavior, we will be stuck with an almost an impossible task of counting and keeping track of number of organisms in a particular environment. One such challenge is tracking insect pollinators for example: Honeybees, Bumblebees, wasps, etc. Biodiversity among insect pollinators is a linchpin of ecological health. It ensures resilient ecosystems, supporting plant species' reproduction, agricultural productivity, and the food webs dependent on those plants. With a variety of pollinators, the risk that one species' decline will devastate the ecosystem is reduced. Each species plays a unique role, making the system more stable and efficient.

Imagine standing in the middle of a sprawling sunflower field, golden petals stretching as far as the eye can see, under a radiant sky. These fields aren't just a feast for the eyesâ€”they're ecological hotspots. Insect pollinators buzz from flower to flower, performing the critical job of pollination, ensuring the continuity of not just sunflowers, but many other interconnected plants and animals.
Here, we try to track these pollinators' interaction time and try to olot interaction patterns 

The following aima e achieved:
1.Real-Time detection of the insect visiting the sunflower using a machine learning algorithm.
2.Tracking the trajectoy of the insect
3.Time spent by the insect on the flower.
4.Identifying faslse detections and trouble shooting
